## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 10

The ideal answer for each of the following questions consists of two or three sentences.


1. What role do purpose statements play? 


They explain what the code is supposed to do, and ideally, what it actually does. This includes mutations, blocking behavior, return values, exceptions, and parameters. Things that help someone use (and maybe understand) what you've written without having to step through.

They are also important in maintaining function; if you refactor a method or class and intend to keep the functionality intact, the purpose statement should still reflect the new code.


2. How do unit tests help with software development?


There are two functions of unit tests. Confidence in code doing what it's supposed to be doing is one, so a subset of the unit tests should cover edge cases and tricky functionality that may break when changes are made. Secondly, unit tests often serve as examples. How to create objects, how to use functions, etc.


3. Which milestone was the most difficult to unit-test?


Milestone 9 was very annoying to unit test; it requires a couple of Mock components for proper testing. We also forgot.


4. Did you struggle with your TAHBPL or was the language helpful?


No, TAHBPL was fine, but Maven was annoying to set up and get working on khoury. This group never set up Maven, so we didn't either.


5. What would you differently if you could send a message to your younger self in early September 2024? 

Attend other sections of swdev on your own. Seeing more presentations, especially good ones, strongly improves your own abilities and may help you with design problems. Also, each class is like a microbiome. The people and ideas flowing in each section feel different and may provide a new perspective or technical approach.
