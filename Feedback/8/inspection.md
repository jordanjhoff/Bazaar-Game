Code Inspection:

- [-10] for linking to the concrete observer class/module. It should preferrably be an interface.
- [+0] No bonus points given as your code doesnâ€™t protect the referee to gracefully resume in case an exception is thrown by the observer. The observers are untrusted.
- [-8] No purpose statement for how the observer works. Honesty points awarded.
- [-8] No purpose statement for how its view works. Honesty points awarded.

Observer Run:

- [-20] The GUI did not contain any buttons for save/prev/next.
- [-30] The images stored under the Tmp/ directory do not contain any lines conveying some information about the image. For ex: "Player 0 is buying a card with success."
