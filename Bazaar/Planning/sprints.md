SUBJECT: Sprint Planning for Bazaar  

In sprint 1, we will develop the data representations for the game pieces. This includes the cards, equations, pebbles, bank, and players' inventories, along with the methods associated with each. Methods we may include would be for setup (creating the cards and equations) and making changes to the game state. 

In sprint 2, we will build the referee to interact with the game elements according to playerInformation requests. This will connect to the game data representations we developed in the previous sprint. We will also add rule adherence to ensure players are making valid moves during their turns. The referee will add the game play to the game pieces, and in doing so, will be in close contact with the data representations from the preivous sprint.

In sprint 3, we will implement the playerInformation logic, such as the trading of pebbles. In doing so, we'll also create a test playerInformation to ensure the game logic and referee function properly. If we have time, we aim to begin developing the playerInformation-referee interface to inform players of the game's rules and allow players to communicate with the referee we built in the second sprint.
