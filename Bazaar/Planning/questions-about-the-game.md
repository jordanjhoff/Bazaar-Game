SUBJECT: Questions for Bazaar Game  

1. Does the game end if there is only one playerInformation left, such that they win by default, or does the end condition for players being kicked only occur when ***all*** players have been kicked?

2. Can a playerInformation purchase multiple cards during their turn even if they drew/exchanged pebbles? The current wording makes it sound as if purchasing multiple cards is a special condition for when a playerInformation has opted out of drawing/exchanging pebbles.

3. When setting up the game should the equations and cards be randomly generated or is there a standard deck for either?
